 Not a nasty dirty wet hole filled with the ends of worms
 En undg책ng smil, no yet a dry bear, sandy hole With nothing to sit down or to eat It was a hobbit hole,
  and that means comfort It had a perfectly round door,
   like a porthole painted green With a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle The door opened to a tubershaped hole, 
   like a tunnel A very comfortable tunnel, without smoke With paneled walls and floor tiles and carpeted 
   Provided with polished chairs and lots and lots of Packs for hats and coats, the hobbit was found to visit us 
   The tunnel, tunnel, wowed, wowed On and on, going fairly, but not quite straight into the side of the hill 
   The hill, as the people for many miles around called it, had many little round doors opening out of it 
   First on one side and then on another No going upstairs for the hobbit Bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries, lots of these Water ropes, 
   he had whole rooms devoted to clothes Kitchen, dining rooms, were all were on the same floor and indeed on the same passage The best rooms were all on the left hand side,
    going in for these Were the only ones who had windows, deep set round windows looking over his garden and middles beyond Sloping down to the river
