 Chapter 1 An unexpected party. In a hole in the ground, they lived a lift a hobbit, not a nasty dirty wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell. Nor yet a dry bear sanded the hole with nothing to sit down or to eat. It was a hobbit hole and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a port hole painted green with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened to a tubeless shaped hole like a tunnel, a very comfortable tunnel without smoke. With paneled walls and floor tiles and carpeted, provided with polished chairs and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats, the hobbit was found of visitors. The tunnel wowed on and on going farly but not quite straight into the side of the hill. The hill as the people for many miles around called it had many little round doors opening out of it first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit. Bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries, lots of these wardrobes, he had whole rooms devoted to clothes, kitchen, dining rooms were all were on the same floor and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left hand side going in for these were the only ones who had windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond sloping down to the river.
